#Python projects
A collection of small Python projrcts to demonstrate basic programming skills, explore diffrent libraries and build hand-on exprience.

## projects

1. **To-Do CLI App**  
   A command-line to-do list application implemented in two versions:
   - [Procedural version](./todo-cli-app): Simple functions for adding, viewing, and deleting tasks.
   - [Object-oriented version](./todo_oop): Structured with Python classes for better code organization.  
   
   Both versions store tasks in a JSON file and allow task management via the terminal.

2. **[Password Generator](./password_generator)**  
   A flexible password generator that allows users to choose the password length and include uppercase letters, digits, and symbols.

3. [Digital Bookshelf](./digital_bookshelf)  
   A small Python project to demonstrate the use of magic methods (`__str__`, `__len__`, `__getitem__`, etc.) in object-oriented programming.

## About 
This repository is part of my personal learning journey in Python. The projects range from biginner to intermediate and 
will grow over time to include more advanced topic like image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.
