## Benchmark Suite

This project includes a benchmarking script (`benchmark.py`) that runs five sorting algorithms  
(MergeSort, QuickSort, BubbleSort, InsertionSort, SelectionSort) on three data sizes (1,000; 5,000; 10,000)  
and compares their execution times in both **Sequential** and **Parallel** modes.

### How to run

```bash
python benchmark.py
